<!--
Spring Native is now superseded by Spring Boot 3 official native support, see [the related reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/native-image.html) for more details.

As a consequence, no new issue on this project should be created, and we recommend trying your use case with the latest Spring Boot 3 version. If you still experience the issue reported here, please open an issue directly on the related Spring project (Spring Framework, Data, Security, Boot, Cloud, etc.) with a reproducer.
